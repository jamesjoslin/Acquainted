    <br>
    <p class="lead">Acquainted is my personal project to learn how to engage my community, serve, and make authentic connections. I believe that what makes us human is our desire to be fully known and loved. Acquainted, this blog, (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV2cu49-22CyFyBbq2YFPGw">which is by no means</a> <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/"> the first of its kind</a>,) uses the unique power of encountering a stranger in order to both know and love individuals. Strangers have a unique vantage point, because they can side-step our fear of judgement and shame. A positive encounter with a stranger can have huge consequences our lives! I personally had an encounter with a stranger, and it changed the trajectory of my entire life. We are now the closest of friends, and He showed me I have that the ability to change lives too.</p>
    <p class="lead">The great thing about this project is that it doesn't stop at a greeting. Acquainted is only a success if it is inviting people into a life-long process of being fully known and loved, and teaching others to do the same. The end goal is a formed relationship.     </p>
    <p class="lead">Acquainted is my way of using my gifts to lead others. If you are interested in gaining resources to do something similar, I would suggest heading to the <a href="{% url 'resources' %}">resources page</a>.</p>
