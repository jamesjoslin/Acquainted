    <p class="lead">My name is James Joslin and this project was a long time in the making. Having been to four different high schools and three different colleges, my life has been shaped by many introductions to new communities. I was given the opportunity to spend a year with the <a href="https://www.impact360institute.org/">Impact360 Institute</a>, which helped me develop my soft skills and worldview. As a result of these experiences, and in wake of COVID-19, I am so excited to finally get out and build my own community. I am currently working on my undergrad as a computer engineer, and hope to get an internship soon. (A.K.A hire me!) I coded and deployed this website myself. (Thank you, YouTube).</p>
    <p class="lead">I would be lying if I said that this project was my own idea. Ideas are often borrowed, and this one is no exception. I hold a high regard for my roommates in college for starting me off and Impact360 for giving me the leadership tools. I am a huge fan of both <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/">Brandon Stanton</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV2cu49-22CyFyBbq2YFPGw">Thoraya Maronesy</a>. I encourage you to check them outâ€”what they do is truly incredible.</p>
    <p class="lead">Acquainted is my way of using my gifts to lead others. If you are interested in gaining resources to do something similar, I would suggest heading to the <a href="{% url 'resources' %}">resources page</a>.</p>
